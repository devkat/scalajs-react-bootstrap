React-Bootstrap for ScalaJS-React
=================================
[React-Bootstrap](http://react-bootstrap.github.io/) components built for [ScalaJS-React](https://github.com/japgolly/scalajs-react).

# Status
Most of the React-Bootstrap components now have a ScalaJS representation. Do note thought that not every props parameter for every component will be present as the
process was entirely manual. If something is missing, or incorrect, please open an issue. 

# Want to help out?
If you have general feedback on how things could be better, feel free to post an issue / gist or
open a PR!  I am looking for ideas like:

# Want to use?

```
libraryDependencies += "com.github.littlenag" %%% "scalajs-react-bootstrap" % "0.0.1-SNAPSHOT"
```
